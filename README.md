# glenbot2_library
The "glenbot2_library.php" PHP file will be used by many scripts within foundation.glencooper.com

All of this source code I developed entirely myself as a self-taught PHP developer.  You may use it however you want.  Hopefully it will help you in some way.  Do yourself a favor and BUY BITCOIN, but only as much as you can afford to lose (in case you do something stupid like make a human-error mistake along the way).  I believe it will be worth 100x more than it is now within a couple years.  The Lightning Network is real and will change everything.
